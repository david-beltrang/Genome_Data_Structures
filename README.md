<h1 align="center">Genomic Data Manipulation and Analysis System</h1>

## ðŸ“Œ Description
**Genomic Data Manipulation and Analysis System**  

This project is a comprehensive console-based application designed to manipulate, analyze, and visualize genetic sequence data in FASTA format. Developed as part of the _Data Structures_ course at University, it showcases the practical application of linear, hierarchical, and non-linear data structures in a real-world bioinformatics context.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Load and summarize genomes**: Read FASTA files, display sequence details, count bases, and generate histograms.  
- **Search and modify sequences**: Identify and count subsequences, mask specific patterns, and save updated data while preserving formatting.  
- **Compress and decompress data**: Implement Huffman coding to efficiently store and recover genetic information in binary `.fabin` files.  
- **Graph-based analysis**: Represent sequences as weighted graphs to compute shortest paths between bases and locate the most distant occurrences of the same base.  

## ðŸ›  Technical Highlights
- **Linear structures** for sequence storage and manipulation.  
- **Trees** (Huffman encoding) for compression tasks.  
- **Graphs** for spatial relationships between genetic bases.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Beyond its educational purpose, this project bridges computational theory and biology, providing tools that reflect real bioinformatics challenges such as genome analysis, sequence search, and efficient data storage. The modular design allows for easy extension and adaptation to other genetic formats or analysis techniques.
